I just started a new job and finally feel like I have my head a bit above water. Of course now I feel like I need to make a side project and I kind of want to honestly. There's a lot of stuff I really want to learn and I enjoy being able to do it on my own and at my own pace. Of course I can learn stuff through my job but some things I don't have the time to learn on the job so hopefully this side project gives me a space I can do that! 

Another reason I really want to build this side project is because it's something that I think might scratch my own itch. People always say these are the best side projects to create and I hope it's true. Currently I write my To-Do list, weekly goals, and notes about the days/weeks in a notebook. I enjoy having my notebook and sometimes it feels nice to cross things off in paper, but it's starting to become a hassle. 

I think the most frustrating part currently is that I have a lot of things on my to-do list that are repetitive or occur every week. For example chores, working out, and studying Japanese are all things that I do multiple times a week and repeat. Because my schedule is pretty repetitive I know exactly when I'm going to do certain chores that I don't necessarily need to write them down but then it looks like I'm doing anything so I try to add extra stuff that can't possibly all fit. 

As much as I love my notebook it would be nice if I could easily have tasks repeat every Monday for example or move tasks to the next day without making a mess of my notebook. 

Even though the concept it pretty simple: a calendar like to-do list where I can keep track of my to-dos, mood for the day, and notes. I think there's a lot of room to add extra features which will be fun and I can still learn a lot about the technology by building stuff and encountering problems on my own. 

I'll be trying to build in public ish by creating this changelog to document my thoughts, my process, wins, and struggles that I encountered. Hopefully this is useful to both me and you! 

I normally just jump right into the code and get overwhelmed but just slog through it anyway. But this time I'm trying to be more intentional and diagram and mockup what I can to get a better idea of the app. So I'll actually be spending some time creating user stories, wireframes, and designs! 

For wireframes I'll be using Figma, which I've never used before and it has always been a bit overwhelming. 

## User Stories 
I'm trying to make my user stories ahead of time to get a better idea of what I need to build and not get distracted by things I want to do in the future. Although I honestly do worry about how difficult it might be to add stuff later down the road. If I'm having difficulty does that mean I built it poorly or didn't have a good idea of how everything might work together? 

- Users should be able to login or sign up 
- Users should be able to create a Todo for a specific day
- Users should be able to complete Todos
- Users should be able to delete Todos
- Users should be able to edit the text of Todos

I think these are good basic user stories that I can start with.

### Backlog
This is just a general backlog list and I'm sure it will grow bigger and hopefully I can get to some of this stuff and it isn't too overwhelming. Hopefully I actually build the app so I can get to here. There's a high probability I start building this app and then I stop in like a month...
- Users should be able to add a Mood
- Users should be able to edit a Mood
- Users should be able to add notes
- Users should be able to edit notes
- Users should be able to move Todos to another date
- Users should be able to set up reoccuring Todos

## Technology
Another reason I really want to build this app is because it gives me a low pressure environment where I can explore new technology or level up my skills. For this project I'd really like to specifically get better at TypeScript and testing. 

- React/ Next.js
- TypeScript
- GraphQL
- Apollo
- React Testing Library
- Jest
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL
- TypeORM
