- what is the purpose or role of that HTML element? 
- there are so many different elements
    - how do you choose what to use? 
- sometimes we choose elements based on what they do or how they look instead of the semantic meaning behind the element
    - using lots of divs or adding more than 1 h1 element because of the style that it looks like 
    - you can also do the opposite and use something like a span and style it to look exactly like a heading but that doesn't give any semantic value
- html elements should be chosen to represent the data that's going to be displayed and not based on it's default styling
- semantic markup helps improve
    - SEO
    - navigating a website with a screenreader
- There are about 100 semantic elements 
- Easy to forget how many different elements there are and hard to learn all of them at the beginning
- Even while writing this article I found areas where I can improve
    - I have a component called `ArticleBlurb` which was using a `div` instead of the more semantic `article`
    - I was also using an `h3` tag when there were no `h2` tags. Ideally you don't want to skip heading elements

```html
<div> <!-- A more semantic tag to use would be <article> -->
    <Link to={fields.slug}>
    <h3>{frontmatter.title}</h3> <!-- Should use h2 instead of skipping to h3 -->
    <span>{frontmatter.date}</span>
    <span>:{frontmatter.status}</span>
    <p>{excerpt}</p>
    </Link>
</div>
```
