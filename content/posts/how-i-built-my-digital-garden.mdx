I learned a lot about digital gardens from [Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/) and decided to build my own after watching this [panel](https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-sector-the-future-of-mdx-and-digital-gardens). The main reason I decided to make my own digital garden was the pressure I kept putting on myself to produce perfect polished content. Instead of creating more content and learning, I left my articles unpublished. If you want to read more about digital gardens and learn more about my reasoning check out my other [post, "What is a digital garden?"](https://www.jenkens.dev/blog/digital-garden).

## Why Gatsby?

Ever since I first learned Gatsby I enjoyed working with it and have made multiple personal websites. It worked great for me and I was able to set everything up pretty quickly. One fun thing that Gatsby utilizes is GraphQL. We can use Gatsby and GraphQL to create pages for our garden from Markdown files. Now I don't need to have a backend setup and when I want to create a new post, all I have to do is create a Markdown file in my content/posts folder. I don't think GraphQL knowledge is required for this but if you want to learn a bit more about my favorite technology check out this [post, "What is GraphQL"](https://www.jenkens.dev/blog/what-is-graphql/)! 

I know [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a popular option but personally it seemed to have too many bells and whistles for what I was doing. I also already knew Gatsby so no need to try and use a new technology. That being said, if you want to use Next feel free, but this post will be going through the [Gatsby docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-0/).

I'll be treating this post like a walkthrough so hopefully I explain everything well enough for you to follow along. With that being said here's a link to the github repo where you can find all the code written in this article. Also feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jenkens_) if you have any questions. 

## Part 1 Walkthrough 
Following along with the [Part 1 Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-1/), after installing all the necessary stuff, I'm going to run the `gatsby new` command. 

Of course I didn't have the Gatsby CLI already installed so I needed to use `sudo npm i -g gatsby-cli`. We are off to a great start. 

Following along the command prompt initiated by `gatsby new` 
What would you like to call your site?
- digital garden
What would you like to name the folder where your site will be created
- I hit enter which corresponds to "Coding_Projects/digital-garden"
Will you be using a CMS?
- No (or I'll add it later)
Would you like to install a styling system? 
- No (or I'll add it later)
Would you like to install additional features with other plugins?
- Use the arrow keys to navigate to "Add Markdown and MDX support", hit space to select, use the arrow keys to navigate to "Done" and then hit Enter
Enter one more time to get finalize the creation! 

Hopefully if everything went well you, after you run `npm start` and open up localhost you should see something like this!

First thing I did was clean up a lot of this code that I didn't need. 

Now the code in `index.js` looks like: 

```jsx
import * as React from "react";

const IndexPage = () => {
  return (
    <main>
      <title>Digital Garden Starter</title>
      <h1>Welcome to my Digital Garden!</h1>
    </main>
  );
};

export default IndexPage;
```

Now we have a quick home page but what about creating other pages? We can create other pages quickly by creating a component inside the `src/pages` directory. So we'll create a new file `src/pages/articles.js` and Gatsby will automatically create a page at "/articles" that displays this component. 

```jsx
import * as React from "react";

const ArticlesPage = () => {
  return (
    <main>
      <title>Articles</title>
      <h1>Feel free to peruse all the articles in my garden!</h1>
    </main>
  );
};

export default ArticlesPage;
```

After saving this new page we can navigate to `localhost:8000/articles` and see our component! Because we have two pages now and want to have a light/dark mode toggle later we can just create a navigation bar now to easily switch between pages. 

I like to keep my components organized so I'll create a `src/components` folder and then create the file for `Navbar.js`. 

```jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Link } from "gatsby";

const Navbar = () => {
  return (
    <nav>
      <Link to="/">Home</Link>
      <Link to="/articles">Articles</Link>
    </nav>
  );
};

export default Navbar;
```

The biggest thing to point out in our `Navbar` component is the `Link` component we are using from Gatsby. The `Link` component that Gatsby gives us is very similar to an `<a>`. The `to` prop is similar to the `href` attribute on `<a>` tags. But one of the benefits to using the `Link` component is that it gives us a performance boost. When one of these `Link` tags is in view the resources for that specific page are requested. Then when you navigate to that page it loads much faster than if the resources were requested on click. 

`Link` components are used for linking between pages **within** your site. That's why they are perfect for the `Navbar`, but if I wanted to link to say MDN docs we would still want to use an `<a>` tag. 

After we've built the `Navbar` component and imported it into `index.js` we should see a *beautiful* nav bar that lets us easily navigate to the articles page. 

<img src="/dgStarterNavbar.png" alt="Starter Gatsby site that shows a navbar with two links: Home and Articles. And a header with text that says Welcome to my Digital Garden!" />

If we click the "Articles" link we should be routed to `localhost:8000/articles`.

Because we just imported the `Navbar` into our `index.js` and not our `articles.js` page we no longer see the Navbar. We could import the `Navbar` component into the articles page but this can quickly get tedious as we start to have more pages or more components that are repeated throughout pages like a footer. 

So we'll create a custom `Layout` component that will be responsible for displaying components that are shared throughout multiple pages. 

```jsx
import * as React from "react";
import Navbar from "./Navbar";

const Layout = ({ pageTitle, children }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <title>{pageTitle}</title>
      <Navbar />
      <main>{children}</main>
    </div>
  );
};
export default Layout;
```

In the `Layout` component we can take advantage of the `children` props in order to wrap our pages. Now we can import this `Layout` component into our pages to see the `Navbar` on all the pages and any other repeat components we end up adding to `Layout`

```jsx
import * as React from "react";
import Layout from "../components/Layout";

const ArticlesPage = () => {
  return (
    <Layout pageTitle="Articles">
      <h1>Feel free to peruse all the articles in my garden!</h1>
    </Layout>
  );
};

export default ArticlesPage;
```

One of the great reasons of creating a digital garden with Gatsby is we can create all our content in Markdown and keep it in our local filesystem and access that data through GraphQL and gatsby plugins. 

We can write GraphQL queries inside specific components to query data we want to use. When Gatsby builds the site, it will find all those GraphQL queries, run them, and pass that data into the the component. 

We can create an articles folder at the top of the directory to hold our of the content we are going to create. To access these files we will need to use the Gatsby plugin, `gatsby-source-filesystem` 
- `npm install gatsby-source-filesystem`

```
plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "gatsby-source-filesystem",
      options: {
        name: "articles",
        path: `${__dirname}/articles`,
      },
    },
  ],
```

Now we have the plugin and we've pointed it to the folder with all our content. Now we just need to write a GraphQL query to access the data. 

```
query MyQuery {
  allFile {
    nodes {
      name
    }
  }
}
``` 

Pulling data into page components is a bit different than pulling data into regular building block components like a Layout component. When we want to access GraphQL data in a page component we create a variable that holds the GraphQL query and then when Gatsby builds the site, it will run that query and pass the data into the page component as a prop called `data`

```jsx
import * as React from "react";
import Layout from "../components/Layout";
import { graphql } from "gatsby";

const ArticlesPage = ({ data }) => {
  console.log(data);
  return (
    <Layout pageTitle="Articles">
      <h1>Feel free to peruse all the articles in my garden!</h1>
      <ul>
        {data.allFile.nodes.map((node) => (
          <li key={node.name}>{node.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </Layout>
  );
};

export const query = graphql`
  query {
    allFile {
      nodes {
        name
      }
    }
  }
`;

export default ArticlesPage;
```

*Note* If you're following along with this article, make sure you restart your server. I ran into an error saying I couldn't `.map()` over undefined and I assume that's because there was no `data` because the GraphQL query is run on build.
