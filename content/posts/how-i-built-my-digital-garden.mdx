I learned a lot about digital gardens from [Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/) and decided to build my own after watching this [panel](https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-sector-the-future-of-mdx-and-digital-gardens). The main reason I decided to make my own digital garden was the pressure I kept putting on myself to produce perfect polished content. Instead of creating more content and learning, I left my articles unpublished. If you want to read more about digital gardens and learn more about my reasoning check out my other [post, "What is a digital garden?"](https://www.jenkens.dev/blog/digital-garden).

## Why Gatsby?

Ever since I first learned Gatsby I enjoyed working with it and have made multiple personal websites. It worked great for me and I was able to set everything up pretty quickly. One fun thing that Gatsby utilizes is GraphQL. We can use Gatsby and GraphQL to create pages for our garden from Markdown files. Now I don't need to have a backend setup and when I want to create a new post, all I have to do is create a Markdown file in my content/posts folder. I don't think GraphQL knowledge is required for this but if you want to learn a bit more about my favorite technology check out this [post, "What is GraphQL"](https://www.jenkens.dev/blog/what-is-graphql/)! 

I know [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a popular option but personally it seemed to have too many bells and whistles for what I was doing. I also already knew Gatsby so no need to try and use a new technology. That being said, if you want to use Next feel free, but this post will be going through the [Gatsby docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-0/).

I'll be treating this post like a walkthrough so hopefully I explain everything well enough for you to follow along. With that being said here's a link to the github repo where you can find all the code written in this article. Also feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jenkens_) if you have any questions. 

## Part 1 Walkthrough 
Following along with the [Part 1 Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-1/), after installing all the necessary stuff, I'm going to run the `gatsby new` command. 

Of course I didn't have the Gatsby CLI already installed so I needed to use `sudo npm i -g gatsby-cli`. We are off to a great start. 

Following along the command prompt initiated by `gatsby new`
