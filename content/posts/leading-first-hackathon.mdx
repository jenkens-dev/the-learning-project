- During bootcamp I decided to do another democracy lab hackathon with members of my cohort 
- It was me and 3 other people and we came with a murky idea of what we wanted to do
- I was the leader and had to make a short presentation to convince people to come join us
- We had 6 people join us, which made me happy and was a lot more than I expected! 
- After the hackathon I immediately knew I had a lot of things I wanted to improve next time I decided to lead a hackathon
- Solidify your user stories for the app
  - Keep them simple 
- Create the github repos ahead of time, with a good README and installation instructions
- Create some basic user flows 
- Create small tasks so team members can decide what they want to work on and tasks can be assigned easier
- Create mock data so frontend and backend to work in parallel
