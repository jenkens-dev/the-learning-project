- This is my personal experience and opinion
- Everyone has a different amount of time and privilege 
    - take everything with a grain of salt
- Job searching is a marathon not a sprint
- takes notes! I have a notion document where I keep track of all the companies I'm interviewing with 
    - prepare questions: link to interview question article
- utilize your network 
    - posted on linkedin 
    - put out a job search tweet on linkedin
- build in public
    - link to article about how to build in public
- learn from every interview 
    - fail forward
- try not to be too hard on yourself
    - i was still denied
    - i still failed technical interviews
