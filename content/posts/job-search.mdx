- there's always a bit of luck in job searching so you need to stack that luck in your favor

## Caveats     

The first thing I want to address is that this post is based on my personal experience and opinion. I don't want this to be another job search post where I can guarantee you'll get a job if you follow these steps. I also want to acknowledge the priviledge I have. This is not my first job search. I have 1 year of experience working a contract position for Microsoft. I have a bit of savings so I don't have to immediately find another position. I don't have any responsibilties when it comes to children or a partner. This has allowed me to focus and give more time to my job search than most. Please take everything I say with a grain of salt and hopefully you can utilize some of the things I did. 

## First steps 
Job searching is definitely a marathon and not a sprint. Especially since my contract ended at the end of September I knew that the job market might be a little slow. I didn't want to burn out immediately. I was able to take a week off after my contract to destress and preapre for job search. Once again this is a huge priviledge for me. During the week off I thought about how I wanted to approach job searching. I created a plan adn thought about my strengths and weakness. 

It can be tough and overwhelming to come up with plan. There's so many things to do and sometimes it can feel like an uphill battle. You need to apply for jobs, study for interviews, update projects and code to keep skills fresh or learn new things. 

Personally I think it's better to apply to fewer positions that I'm more interested in. I think this genuniely comes across in my interviewing.

The first thing I did was post a [tweet](https://twitter.com/jenkens_/status/1447641903047061508) saying I was looking for a new job. I was able to get some responses from companies and connect with other job searchers. After posting a looking for work tweet I changed my LinkedIn [status](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6853400928394080256/) to "#OpenToWork". This helps me better connect with recruiters. I also updated my LinkedIn tagline to say Frontend Developer (React/TypeScript). I've heard including some technology keywords in your tagline helps when recruiters are searching. 

## Build in public
One of the things I decided I was going to do this job search was to build in public. Building in public can help me market myself and get my name out there. It can show companies that I have technical skills and how I approach problems. Building in public can be a bit scary but I think there are so many benefits. 

If you're searching for your first job it can be really hard to get your foot in the door. One way is to build things and get that experince. You have to make yourself as a candidate a little less risky. You can use this project to create a developer portfolio and creating a project is a great thing to blog about. This will help you get better at communicating technical things and teaching through writing is a great way to cement what you're learning.

## Interviewing
You've probably heard this before but I really think the mindset that "interviewing is a two way street" really helped me during this job search. It can be really easy to think that you have to get a job. And it **has** to be **this** job. I don't know about you, but I'm not really good under pressure. I shouldn't be piling this pressure onto myself. I don't want to take a job that isn't right for me just because I want a developer job. I'm interviewing the company to see if they can support me. If they are the right fit for me.

One thing that really helped me the second time around was creating a Notion document with all the companies I'm interviewing with. My memory isn't great, so I like to use the doc to write down the questions I prepared before the interview, what we talked about, and my general feeling after the interviews. This helps me compare companies and I use this information to figure out which questions I want to ask next. 

This might be obvious, but please prepare questions before your interviews and research your interviewers. Here's a list of my [favorite interview questions to ask](https://www.jenkens.dev/blog/my-favorite-interview-questions/), but definitely create some that are tailored to you. Researching my interviewers can also affect the interview questions I want to ask. 

I like to put the questions I asked to specific interviewers in my notion document so I don't repeat questions unless I want to. That way I can make sure I have a full understanding of the role, the company environement, and how the company will support me. 

I'm gunna be honest. I really hate algorithms. Even though I'm not great at algorithms I decided not to spend my free time studying and practicing algorithms. This definitely hurt me, but I was willing to make this sacrifice. A lot of my interviews will ask algorithm questions but a lot of them also ask me to pair program with React. I really like these questions since they play more to my strengths and I feel they match what I would typically do on a day-today basis. 

### Learn from every interview
Job searching the second time around defintely feels better but I still failed my fair share of interviews. Everyone fails interviews and gets ghosted so I think it's important not to be too negative on yourself. After every interview I try and think about what went well and waht didn't go well. That way I can improve for the next time. I like to take the mentality of failing forward. I use every failure to make sure the next interview is even a little bit better. I try not to make the same mistakes, and use even this little bit of experience improve. 

This also doesn't have to be advice for just technical interviews. You can improve your behavioral interviews through experience and getting more comfortable talking about yourself and your strengths.
