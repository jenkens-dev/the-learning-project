Side projects are always something that we are encouraged to do in our free time as developers. It can be hard to find time for side projects and stay consistent with them. A lot of developers have unfinished side projects and feel shame around starting new ones without perfecting or finishing their previous side projects. There's nothing wrong with retiring a side project or putting it on the back burner if you're more interested in something else. 

## There's no such thing as a "failed" side project
A lot of people consider unfinished side projects as failures and they feel shame about them. But I truly believe there's no such thing as a failed side project. We are constantly learning and growing and every side project is an opportunity to grow and learn something new. I think switching the narrative and changing our mindset around side projects is more important than "finishing" a side project. As long as I learn something a side project can be a success. When we start new side projects we don't start from nothing. We use our past experience. We know how to do things now that we might not have before or know what not to do. Maybe you learned how to use redux for a side project but didn't "finish" that side project and stopped working on it. The next time you start a side project you can use redux and maybe it's a lot easier this time or makes more sense since you've used it before. 

## Know your goals 
I think it's important to have some goals in mind when you start a side project. When I started side projects in the past I wanted something people would use, wanted to learn how to build certain features (like achievements), and wanted to learn new technologies. While something like this is totally possible it can be really hard since every step is a challenge. If I was to restart that side project now I would probably split it up into a couple of different projects or take out some of the technologies I didn't know. It became hard to reach my goal of getting people to use my side project, when it wasn't ready to use because I struggled a lot building it with all the new technology I added. If I had used something I was familiar with and just focused on acquiring users I might have been more successful. 

## Know when to ship or stop 
If you understand what you want out of a side project it makes it easier stop or ship. Want people to use your app? Ship. Your project is probably more "ready" than you realize. There's a saying that perfect never ships. Shipping your side project can help you gauge if people are interested in it and what people want. Building something out fully in private can cause you to build features people don't want. But if you ship early you can get feedback. And that makes it easier for you to iterate on your app.

If you built a side project to learn a new technology it's totally okay to stop if you aren't interested or enjoying yourself anymore. Those things that you've learned are now a part of your toolkit and will help you in the future. Don't force yourself to work on something you aren't enjoying.
