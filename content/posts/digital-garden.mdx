A digital garden is a different way of writing and creating content. I first learned about digital gardens from [Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden), [swyx](https://www.swyx.io/writing/digital-garden-tos/), and [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden). 

Everyones garden is different but they tend to focus on the process of creating content and curating it as you learn and grow. Like real gardens, each post is at a different stage. They're either "finished" (🌻), or in progress (👩‍🌾) and are being pruned and updated as I learn more. 

## Why digital gardening? 

I've always enjoyed talking about what I'm learning and showcasing my progress as a developer. Flatiron required all their students to write blogs and this was the perfect chance, I wrote quite a few blogs on [dev.to](https://dev.to/talia) and some even got some views! 

Post-graduation I started getting more anxiety out posting blogs and agonizing over their correctness and my general writing skills. Suddenly blogs became less fun and more of a way to market myself for the job search. I whole-heartedly agree with what [Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/on-writing-more) said:

> _Everybody is treating writing as a "content marketing strategy" and using it to "build a personal brand" which leads to the fundamental flawed idea that everything you post has to be polished to perfection and ready to be consumed._

To escape this need for perfection and get back to writing and exploring for fun, enter the digital garden!

As I'm writing this post I feel a lot less pressure and it feels more like a conversation. I hope people are encouraged to start their own garden and release more thoughts and notes into the world. We hold ourselves to their high standards of perfection and I much rather be focusing on growing and learning. 

I want this garden to be a place where I can learn. Expect some mistakes, ramblings, and incomplete articles as you peruse the garden.
