- A lot of newer developers see experienced developers and ask them to be their mentors 
- Or think they need a dedicated mentor to make progress and teach them
- Look for a public mentor like [Angie Jones](https://mobile.twitter.com/techgirl1908/status/1413502964942082054) or other creators who share their knowledge
- That puts a lot of pressure on the mentor and also asks them to dedicate a lot of their free time 
- Following someone's content is a great way to get that "mentorship" aspect
- One of the greatest mentors I've had is the Virtual Coffee community
    - I get to learn from everyone around me 
    - Learn from their experience
    - I feel motivated and encouraged by them
    - I can learn just by being a fly on the wall
- Because I'm learning from a community instead of just one person I can learn about a lot of different things
    - I'm a frontend developer by nature so a lot of content creators I follow talk about frontend and I can learn from them.
    - But when I'm apart of a community I can learn about things like devops and aspects of programming that I don't know about
    - You get a lot of different views and opinions
    - You get people who are at different stages of their careers
        - You can learn from both those who are more senior or more junior from you
- But I can also give back to that community 
    - Leveling up the community is a great feeling and also beneficial to you 
    - When you learn something from a community you can write content about it and that might help teach someone else.
    - It feels great when you can learn something, release content about that subject, and then that content teaches someone else
    - And hopefully from there, the cycle of teaching and learning continues! 
- Learn how to ask good questions 
    - Broad questions like, "What technology should I learn?" are hard to answer
    - It's easier to answer a question if there are specific details
    - Easier to answer questions if you talk about what you tried or what you were doing.
