Job searching really stinks, especially when you enjoyed your job. A ton of companies are going through layoffs and unfortunately I was affected. I was excited for the new year to keep pushing beyond and become and even better engineer. I had coordinated with my manager and made a couple of different goals to hit in the first 6 months. Saw a meeting on my calendar and thought that I was finally being recognized for my growth and all the hard work I put in. Then I woke up on Friday looking forward to starting a big feature, only to find myself lock out of my email and slack. I took the following week off to just take care of myself, and fight through all the stress and anxiety I felt. By the end of the week I was feeling much better. But nothing really prepared me for the second week. I think my brain finally caught up and I realized this wasn't a vacation. This was my new normal. I grieved for myself, all my co-workers who were also effected, as well as the 1000s of people I didn't know who are now in a similar situation. 

While I have a ton more experience and confidence this time around I think this job search will be even harder. I watched this [video by Theo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kte-t1pQQ3I) and it really put into perspective what I was already feeling. I'm going to write here about my progress each week and what I'm learning. I'll also have a post here (insert post to calendar project), about the side project I'm building. I think building and creating and writing about it is a lot more interesting for me and will be more helpful in my job search. I've never been a fan of leetcode so this works in my favor. I'll still be applying for positions but not nearly as many as I usually would. I plan on attending more online events with communities I've been apart of and posting more on Twitter and LinkedIn to get in front of potential future co-workers!
